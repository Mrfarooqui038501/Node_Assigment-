# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Task Queue API

## Overview

This project is a Node.js API that implements a task queueing system with rate limiting. The API allows users to submit tasks to be executed, and the system ensures that the tasks are executed at a rate that does not exceed the specified limits.

## Requirements

Node.js 14 or higher
Express.js 4.21 or higher
Redis 4.7 or higher
ioredis 5.4 or higher
Project Structure

## The project is organized into the following directories:

config: contains configuration files for the project
logs: contains log files generated by the project
server: contains the Express.js server code
task-queue: contains the task queueing system code
task: contains the task execution code
Approach

## The project uses the following approach to implement the task queueing system with rate limiting:

Task Queueing: The project uses a task queueing system to manage the tasks submitted by users. The task queueing system is implemented using a Redis database.
Rate Limiting: The project uses rate limiting to ensure that the tasks are executed at a rate that does not exceed the specified limits. The rate limiting is implemented using the express-rate-limit middleware.
Task Execution: The project uses a task execution function to execute the tasks in the task queue. The task execution function is implemented using a Node.js async function.
Solution

## The project provides the following solution to the task queueing system with rate limiting:

Task Queueing System: The project provides a task queueing system that allows users to submit tasks to be executed. The task queueing system is implemented using a Redis database.
Rate Limiting: The project provides rate limiting to ensure that the tasks are executed at a rate that does not exceed the specified limits. The rate limiting is implemented using the express-rate-limit middleware.
Task Execution: The project provides a task execution function to execute the tasks in the task queue. The task execution function is implemented using a Node.js async function.
Usage

## To use the project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Start the server using npm start.
Use a tool like Postman to submit tasks to the API.
API Endpoints

## The project provides the following API endpoints:

POST /api/v1/task: submits a task to the task queueing system.
Example Usage

## Here is an example of how to use the API endpoint to submit a task:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/task \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user_id": "123"}'
This will submit a task to the task queueing system with the user ID 123.

## Logs

The project generates log files in the logs directory. The log files contain information about the tasks executed by the system.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the project, check the following:

Make sure that the Redis database is running and configured correctly.
Make sure that the express-rate-limit middleware is configured correctly.
Check the log files for any errors or issues.
